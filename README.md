# 3dch-eng
A 3D Translation of the E3 2010 tech demo "3D Challenge" for the Nintendo 3DS.

# How to submit a translation
First of all clone this repository to your hard drive. 
You can do this directly from the GitHub website 
or by using applications such as GitHub Desktop.
Then you'll need Kuriimu, an open-source translator
for Nintendo String Files (.msbt). Download it from the project's [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu/releases)
and download the latest .rar archive containing the Kuriimu Binaries.
Now that you have all of the needed files, open Kuriimu and drag the .msbt
file onto the active folder. Then you can choose a string and make your changes.
Once you're done, save the file and submit it in a pull request. If you are not
familiar with GitHub's PR system, you can read about it [here.] (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

# Special Thanks

# 3dch-eng
A 3D Translation of the E3 2010 tech demo "3D Challenge" for the Nintendo 3DS.

# How to install this mod
To make this work you'll need to have:<br/>
- A 3DS (duh)<br/>
- Luma CFW (also duh)<br/>
- Game Patching enabled in your [luma config](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features)<br/>

To install the mod you'll need to download the [latest zip release](https://github.com/matthew-5pl/3dch-eng/releases/latest) and unzip it.<br/>
Plug your 3DS's SD Card or microSD Card into your computer and open its contents.<br/>
If not present, create a folder named "titles" in your /luma/ folder.<br/>
Open the titles folder and drag the "0004001000020D00" folder into it.<br/>
Turn on your 3DS and open 3D Challenge.<br/>
Profit

# How to submit a translation
First of all clone this repository to your hard drive. 
You can do this directly from the GitHub website 
or by using applications such as GitHub Desktop.
Then you'll need Kuriimu, an open-source translator
for Nintendo String Files (.msbt). Download it from the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu/releases)
and download the latest .rar archive containing the Kuriimu Binaries.
Now that you have all of the needed files, open Kuriimu and drag the .msbt
file onto the active folder. Then you can choose a string and make your changes.
Once you're done, save the file and submit it in a pull request. If you are not
familiar with GitHub's PR system, you can read about it [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

# Special Thanks

The sweet people at [Forest of Illusion](https://twitter.com/forestillusion) for publishing the game so I could extract it and translate it <br/>
